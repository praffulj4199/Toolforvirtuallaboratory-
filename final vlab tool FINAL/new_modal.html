							<h4>Introduction</h4>
							<hr>
						  	<p>
				        	In the first step you need to make a decision regarding the broad goal of the experiment. As you can see from the figure below the goal of the experiment may be one or more of the four dimensions. This is the most important step, as all the further steps will depend on what you wish to achieve from the experiment.

						<div class="collapse" id="collapseExample12" data-parent="#step1parent">
							<h4>Taxonomy</h4>
							<hr>
						  	<p>
				          A taxonomy is used to classify things. The Revised Bloom’s taxonomy of educational objectives defines levels of objectives in three domains:
					<ul>
						<li>Cognitive (knowledge based)</li>
						<li>Affective (emotive based) </li>
						<li>Psychomotor (action based)</li>
				    </ul>


 				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Knowledge</li>
					<p>
						The knowledge dimension has four components that are Facts, Concepts, Principles and Procedures.
					</p>
					<p>
						What is a fact?<br><br>

It is logically associated pieces of information. Some examples are names, dates, and events. For the Basic and Advanced Electronics laboratory environment the examples of facts are components, equipment etc.

					</p>

					<p>
						What is a concept? <br><br>

A concept is defined by a set of shared features found in each example of the concept. That is, every example of a concept shares certain ‘must have’ features with all other examples of the concept. In addition to these ‘must have’ features, the examples can have other features, which other examples of the concept may or may not have. The can have features describe the many ways examples of a concept can be different. For the Basic and Advanced Electronics laboratory environment the examples of concepts are PN Junction diode, Transistor etc.

					</p>

					<p>
						What is a principle?<br><br>
A principle is basically either cause-and-effect or relationships. It explains or predicts why something happens in a particular way. For the Basic and Advanced Electronics laboratory environment the examples of principles are Ohms law, Barkhausen criterion for oscillation etc.

					</p>

					<p>
						What is a procedure?<br><br>
It is a set of ordered steps, sequenced to solve a problem or accomplish a goal. For the Basic and Advanced Electronics laboratory environment the examples of procedures are - A sequence of steps carried out to perform an experiment, A sequence of steps carried out to analyse a circuit etc.

					</p>
					<li>
			        		Skill
			        		<p>
			        			This is the ability to do something well and also termed as expertise. The various skills that can be developed in the laboratory environment are practical skills, manipulative skills, investigative, inquiry process skills etc. The design of the experiment will depend on the type of skill you wish to achieve. Through this tool we will be providing you with guidelines on how to design the experiment for the above four skills.

			        		</p>
			        	</li>
			        	<li>
			        		Cognitive Ability
			        		<p>
			        			This is the ability of an individual to perform the various mental activities most closely associated with learning and problem solving. Through this tool we will provide guidelines for the cognitive abilities of Analysis, Problem Solving, Application and Inquiry.

			        		</p>
			        	</li>
			        	<li>
			        		Attitude
			        		<p>
			        			This is predisposition or a tendency to respond positively or negatively towards a certain idea, object, person, or situation. Attitude influences an individual's choice of action, and responses to challenges, incentives, and rewards. This is related to the affective domain and we will be providing guidelines only on the affective component of team work in this tool.

			        		</p>
			        	</li>
				</ol>
							<p>
			        		The knowledge dimension has four components – facts, concepts, principle and procedures. For each of these components there are six levels depending on the difficulty of the learning. These levels as per the Revised Blooms taxonomy are
							Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate and Create.
							The experiment design will vary depending on what target level you decide to achieve.

							<h4>Introduction</h4>
							<p>The second step in the experiment design process is the formulation of learning objectives aligned to the Broad goal of the experiment.</p>
							<ol>
							<li>The learning objectives should identify a learning outcome - The objective needs to state what the learner is to perform, not how the learner learns. For example, “The learner will recite the five steps in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.” 
							Evidence of whether the learners have learned the material lies not in watching them read about it but by listening to them explain the principles in their own words.
							</li>
							<li>
							The learning objectives should be precise — It's sometimes difficult to strike a balance between too much and too little precision in an objective. There is a fine line between choosing objectives that reflect an important and meaningful
							outcome of instruction, objectives that trivialize information into isolated facts, and objectives that are extremely vague. Remember, the purpose of an objective is to give different people the same understanding of the 
							desired instructional outcome. 
							</li>
							</ol>
						</div>
						<div class="collapse" id="collapseExample22" data-parent="#stepxparent">
							<h4>How to formulate Learning Objectives?</h4>
							<p>
								As per the definition of learning objectives they need to be very specific and measurable hence you should not use verbs such as understand, visualize etc instead use action verbs such as identify, list,describe,solve etc. 
								Similarly the learning objective should be concerned with the learner and not the teacher hence avoid using verbs such as teach,show,demonstrate etc. 
								</p>

								<i>Examples of valid and clearly defined learning objectives for the course Basic Electronics</i><br><br>
								<ol>
								<li>Student should be able to analyse the BJT amplifier circuits </li>
								<li>Student should be able to describe the effect of the value of β on the output of the amplifier</li>

					<h4>STEP 3:INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGY</h4>
					<hr>
					
					<div class="collapse" id="intro">
						<p>The third step in the experiment design process is the selection of Instructional Strategy depending on the learning objectives you wish to achieve. You may design more than one experiment for one topic based on the target objectives
with different instructional strategies.
<br><br>
<b>Important Tip:</b>
<i>You may even design one experiment per learning objective with each one with a different instructional strategy. The students too can perform multiple experiments on a single topic as the time required to perform a virtual laboratory experiment is very less compared to the traditional laboratory. Also another advantage of the virtual laboratory is that it is available to the students online anytime anywhere.</i> <br><br>
Instruction is a combination of teaching and learning activities. The instructional Strategies determine the approach a teacher may take to achieve learning objectives. We provide guidelines for designing experiments based on the 
following four instructional strategies. 
We provide guidelines so that the experiment designs become more effective and you can achieve your learning objectives. As part of the design you will be designing tasks or activities that the students need to carry out as part
of the experiment. </br></br></p>

							<h4>Introduction</h4>
							<hr>
							<p>
								This is one of the most widely used instructional strategies in science and engineering laboratories since decades. Though it has some advantages it has been criticized to have a cookbook nature and as placing very little emphasis on thinking, being an ineffective means of conceptual change. The experiment design with this strategy can be made more effective by slight modifications in the various tasks and designing the experiment at different difficulty levels.
								<br><br>
								The four important phases in the design process are </br></br>

								<ol>
								<li>Conception, planning and design of experiment</li>
								<li>Execution of experiment</li>
								<LI>Analysis and interpretation</LI>
								<li>Applications</li>
								</ol>

								We provide guidelines for designing tasks in each phase step by step so that the experiment becomes more and more student centered and leading to meaningful learning.

Specify Observations to be taken or data to be gathered 
Specify the measurements to be carried out
Describe the manipulations possible
Specify the various calculations to be carried out
<br><br>
These are the steps in which the students may be asked to carry out multiple observations, measurements and calculations. These steps are also most suitable for developing the investigative, manipulative and analysis skills.
<br><br>
BAE example – PN junction diode
<br><br>
Ask the students to plot the graph of V-I characteristics for different diode specifications. Ask the students to adjust one specification for example the internal resistance of the diode Rs to different values and plot the V-I characteristics. Make the students analyse the change in the nature of the graph for the different values. This can be repeated for each of the specification on which the nature of the graph depends. These tasks are helpful in developing the higher level learning objectives of analysis and evaluation. 
<br><br><br>

Guideline – LO at create level
To achieve the learning objective at create level the students may be asked to design their own observations, measurements and calculations.

							<h4>Scientific Discovery Instructional Strategy</h4>
							<hr>
							<p>
			        	Scientific discovery learning is a typical form of constructive learning based on problem solving activities involving the design and implementation of scientific experiments. SDL is a knowledge construction approach that is based on scientific discovery activities. Discovery (guided-inquiry) learning differs from inquiry (open-inquiry) learning with respect to the outcome of the instruction and to the procedure followed. Whereas in true inquiry instruction the outcome is unknown to both the instructor and the students, in a discovery learning environment the instructor guides the students toward discovering the desired outcome. This is accomplished by giving the students directions for what they are expected to do.

							<h4>Problem-Based Instructional Strategy</h4>
							<hr>
							<p>
			        	The uniqueness of the laboratory lies principally in providing students with opportunities to engage in processes of investigation and inquiry. The laboratory is especially important in the current era in which inquiry has re-emerged as a central style advocated for science teaching and learning. During inquiry tasks, students can engage in cycles of formulating questions, generating hypotheses, planning and carrying out experiments and finally analyzing and summarizing their results. Such inquiry cycles are assumed to improve students’ metacognitive skills as well as their subject-matter expertise. 
<br><br>
In this style, students are presented with a problem statement often lacking in crucial information. From this statement they redefine the problem in their own words and devise a procedure that will lead them to a solution. The problems are “open-ended”. That is, they possess a clear goal, but there are many viable paths toward a solution.

							<h4>Design Assessment of learning</h4>
							<hr>
							<p>In majority of the cases the assessment is carried out to measure the students’ learning. This type of assessment assists teachers to use evidence of students learning such as scores in the assessment questions to assess their achievements as per learning goals and standards. In this assessment the questions asked are aligned to the learning objectives of the experiment. The scores are given to the students based on a rubric for the final outcome. </p>
			        <p>In case of virtual laboratory assessment you can design the assessment as follows</p>
			        <ol>
			        	<li>There may be a pre test to assess the students prior knowledge of the topic</li>
			        	<li>The students may be asked to perform certain tasks aligned to the learning objectives and questions aligned to the tasks may be asked as they perform the particular task. This way the assessment is based on what the students are learning while carrying out laboratory activities and not just on the theoretical knowledge. The following methodology may be followed for this type of assessment.</li>
			        	<img src="images/process.png">
			        	<li>There may be posttest at the end of all the laboratory activities. The scores of this test may be used as evidence of the students learning.</li>

							<h4>Example from BAE course</h4>
							<hr>
							<p>Construct the circuit of Diode as a Clipper and analyse the circuit operation and output.</p>
			        <ol>
			        	Action - Task1 – Select the suitable simulation settings<br>
			        	<li>Reflection Question: What simulation settings will you select to study the operation of the circuit?</li>
						<li>Reflection Question: Why did you choose these simulation settings?</li>
						Action - Task 2 - Observe the output waveform obtained <br>
						<li>Reflection Question: What is the nature of the output waveform? Is it as per the desired result?</li>
						Action - Task 3 – Change the frequency of the input signal <br>
						<li>Reflection Question: Will there be a change in the output if the frequency of the input signal is varied? Why?</li>
						Action - Task 4 – Change the amplitude of the signal <br>
						<li>Reflection Question: Will there be a change in the output if the amplitude of the input signal is varied? Why?</li>
						<li>Reflection Question: What is the range of input signal amplitude for which you get the desired output waveform?</li>
						<li>Reflection Question: What is the range of input signal frequency for which you get the desired output waveform?</li>
						Action - Task 5 – Change the resistor connected in the circuit <br>
						<li>Reflection Question: Will there be a change in the output if the value of resistor is varied? Why?</li>

						<li>Reflection Question: List the diode numbers for which you get identical output waveforms.</li>
						<li>Reflection Question: What would you conclude from the above?</li>
			        </ol>
			        <p>As you can see in this example the student performs a certain task that is action, which is in the objects domain and then answers a reflection question, which is based on the previous action. This sequence of Action + Reflection solves three purposes</p>
			        <ol>
			        	<li>The assessment is based on what the students do while performing the experiment and hence their lab work is getting assessed. This leads to meaningful learning as they come to know the purpose behind each of the action and the results of the same. This helps them in analysis of the circuit and the various operations.</li>
			        	<li>The students are working in the two domains of objects and concepts behind the objects. Thus they get an opportunity to link these two domains, which is a very important aspect of the labwork.</li>
			        	<li>Such type of experiment design also helps in developing the students’ skill of analysis.</li>

							<h4> Design assessment as learning</h4>
							<hr>
							<p>In this type of assessment students are involved in the learning process such that they monitor their own progress. Students use self-assessment to reflect on their learning and work towards learning goals. You can design this type of assessment by using the methodology as shown in the figure and incorporate scaffolds in the form of prompts or dialogs to assist the students understand their own learning.</p>
			        <p>This is easily possible in case of virtual laboratory experiment as the assessment can be integrated along with the experiment, which may be difficult in case of traditional laboratory activities.</p>
			        <p>Example from Basic Electronics course</p>

							<h4>Design assessment for learning</h4>

							<h4>Measurement Metric</h4>
							<hr>
							<p>The assessment can be designed to measure the following</p>
			        <ol type="i">
			        	<li>Students’ knowledge</li>
			        	<li>Students’ skills</li>
			        	<li>Students’ Cognitive abilities</li>
			        	<li>Students’ attitude</li>
			        </ol>
			        <p>The scope of the guidelines is limited to only the two measurement metrics of knowledge and skills. The two other metrics of cognitive abilities and attitudes is beyond the scope of this research.</p>
			        <p><b>Design assessment for measuring the knowledge of the students in the virtual laboratory experiment</b></p>
			        <p>The knowledge has four dimensions – Facts, Concepts, Principles and Procedures. You can design assessment to measure the knowledge of students in each of these dimensions. The learning objectives of the experiment should be formulated according to the knowledge dimension you wish to measure. After formulating the learning objectives the assessment questions should be designed such that they are aligned to the learning objectives. </p>
			        <p>Example from Basic Electronics for assessment of each knowledge dimension</p>
			        <p>Assessment for fact <br>
						Learning objective: Student should be able to recall the circuit diagram of PN junction Diode as a Clipper. <br>
						Task: Construct the circuit diagram of PN junction Diode as a Clipper. <br>
						Assessment question: What specifications of the diode will you select? <br>
					</p>
					<p>
						Assessment for Concepts <br>
						Learning objective: Student should be able to understand the concept of PN junction Diode as a Clipper <br>
						Task: Apply the suitable output to the circuit and observe the output. <br>
						Assessment question: What is the nature of the output waveform? Is it as per the desired result? Why do you think the circuit behaviour is of a Clipper? <br>
					</p>
					<p>
						Assessment for Principles <br>
							Learning objective: Student should be able to identify the linear and non-linear regions in the V-I Characteristics plot of PN Junction Diode <br>
							Tasks: Construct the given circuit. Measure the current flowing through the diode at various values of applied DC voltage. Note down the readings for ten values. Plot the graph of current vs. voltage to obtain the V- I Characteristics of the PN junction diode. Calculate the static and dynamic resistance of the diode from the formulae given in the linear and non-linear region of the characteristics. <br>
							Assessment question: Is the slope of the V-I plots equal everywhere on the graph? What does the slope of the plot indicate?
					</p>
					<p>
						Assessment for Procedure <br>
						Learning objective: Student should be able to carry out the procedure to find the values of gain of Common Emitter Amplifier circuit. <br>
						Tasks: A 2N2222A is connected as shown with 
						R1 = 6.8 kΩ, R2 = 1 kΩ, RC = 3.3 kΩ, RE = 1 kΩ and   VCC = 30V. Assume VBE = 0.7V. Construct the circuit and carry out DC analysis. <br>
						Assessment question: 1. Compute VCC and IC for β = i) 100 and ii) 300.
						2. Compare the theoretical and practical values obtained.

							<h4>Design assessment for measuring the laboratory process skills of the students in the virtual laboratory experiment</h4>
							<hr>
							<p>The students need to develop three laboratory process skills that are Manipulative skills, Investigative skills and Inquiry Skills. You can design assessment to test whether the students have developed these skills or you can develop these skills amongst the students by designing tasks that provide students opportunities to carry out these various activities. After the students perform a particular task ask assessment questions related to that task. If the student is able to answer the assessment question correctly it can be inferred that the student has developed the particular skill.</p>
			        <p>Manipulative skills – The students are said to have developed these skills if they are able to carry out the following tasks - Observations, Measurements, Manipulations, Recording results, Calculations, Explaining experimental techniques, Explaining about various decisions and Working according to the design.</p>
			        <p>Investigative skills - The students are said to have developed these skills if they are able to carry out the following tasks - Transforms results into standard form (tables), Determine relationships (could include graphs), Discuss accuracy of data, Formulate generalizations, Discuss limitations/assumptions of experiment, Explain relationships and Formulate new questions/problems.</p>
			        <p>Inquiry Skills - The students are said to have developed these skills if they are able to carry out the following tasks - Formulate question or problem to be investigated, Formulate hypothesis, Determining replications, Identifying treatments, Defining dependent variable, Defining independent variable, Design experiment, Design observation and measurement procedures, Predict results, Predict applications based on results, Formulate follow up hypotheses and Apply experimental technique to new problem.</p>

							<h4>Method</h4>
							<hr>
							<p>The two methods used for assessment are – Summative and Formative. </p>
			        <p>Guideline 3.1 – How to design summative assessment?</p>
			        <p>The Summative assessment is conducted after a learning phase (ranging from a single course to an entire curriculum) and serves accountability or certification purposes (‘assessment of learning’). Refer the guidelines 1.1 for designing the summative assessment.</p>

							<h4>Design Formative Assessment</h4>
							<hr>
							<p>The formative assessment is conducted during a learning phase with the goal of promoting learning (‘assessment for learning’). Learning is fostered through formative assessment when it succeeds in helping learners identify their weaker and stronger points, and in guiding them to overcome the weaker points during the learning process. This requires learners to develop an understanding of the performance criteria and standards, and helping them do so is a crucial aspect of formative assessment. That is, learners should know what aspects of performance should be assessed (criteria) and what constitutes poor, average, good or excellent performance on those aspects. Refer the guidelines 1.2 for designing the summative assessment.</p>

							<hr>
							<p>Design the assessment questions such that the correct answer to the same indicates that the particular learning objective has been achieved. Also the cognitive level of the question should be same as the cognitive level of the learning objective.</p>
			        <p>
			        	For example: <br>
						The learning objective is: <br>
						Students should be able to graphically draw the characteristics of different types of resistors. <br>

			        	In this step you will be making a decision regarding the virtual laboratory to be used for achieving the different learning objectives and the features that the virtual lab must possess in 	order to achieve the learning objectives.
			        	<br><br>	
						Broad goal – Develop knowledge - Concepts, principles and procedures
						<br><br>
						Cognitive levels – Understand and apply <br><br>
						In order to achieve the learning objectives aligned to this broad goal the virtual lab should possess the following features.</p>

						<ol>
<li>There should be components that are necessary to construct the circuit to carry out the particular set of experiments for the particular course.</li>
<li>There should be equipment that is necessary to measure the various parameters in the circuit.</li>
<li>The simulation of the circuit should produce the necessary output. </li>
<li>The output obtained should be such that the students can carry out observations and measure parameter values.</li>
<li>The students should be able to carry out necessary calculations from the observed values.</li>


						</ol>
						<p>For the BAE virtual lab the necessary features for achieving these learning objectives are</p> <br>
						<ol>
							<li>There should be components such as resistors, inductors, capacitors and linear and non-linear devices such as Diodes, BJT, FET, that are necessary to construct the circuit to carry out the particular experiments for the course.</li>
							<li>There should be equipment such as DC Regulated Power Supply, Ammeter, Voltmeter, Oscilloscope, and Function Generators etc. that is necessary to measure the various parameters in the circuit.</li>
							<li>The simulation of the circuit should produce the necessary plots of the various parameters. </li>
							<li>	The output obtained should be visuals such that the students can carry out observations and measure parameter values.</li>
							<li>The students should be able to carry out necessary calculations from the observed values.</li>
						</ol>
						<img src = "images/5.1.jpg" height = "100%" width = "100%">

						<p>As seen from the above figure the virtual lab has the necessary features so that the students can perform the traditional expository experiment with learning objectives at lower cognitive levels of understand and apply. 
It is not possible to achieve learning objectives at higher cognitive levels of analyze, evaluate and create as it does not have the necessary features.
Similarly it is not suitable for developing the necessary skills except the practical skills. It is also not suitable for the development of cognitive abilities.

</p>


<p>Broad goal – Develop knowledge - Concepts, principles and procedures <br><br>

Cognitive levels – Analyze, Evaluate and Create <br><br>

In order to achieve the learning objectives aligned to this broad goal the virtual lab should possess the following features.
</p>
			 <ol>
			 	<li>There should be components that are necessary to construct the circuit to carry out the particular set of experiments for the particular course. </li>	
<li>There should be a comprehensive set of the components and devices similar to the traditional laboratory so that the students can choose from the set.
	<img src = "images/5.1.1.jpg" height = "100%" width = "100%">
	<img src = "images/5.1.2.jpg" height = "100%" width = "100%"> <br>
	Comprehensive set of linear and non-linear components – This feature provides students with opportunities to select the most appropriate components and devices for the experiment. This is also important for the development of the practical skills.

 </li>
 <li>The students should be able to change the specifications of the components as per their designs. <br>
 		<img src = "images/5.1.3.jpg" height = "100%" width = "100%">
 		<img src = "images/5.1.4.jpg" height = "100%" width = "100%">
 </li>

<li>There should be equipment that is necessary to measure the various parameters in the circuit.</li> 
<li>The simulation of the circuit should produce the necessary output. </li>
<li>The output obtained should be such that the students can carry out observations and measure parameter values.</li>
<li>	The students should be able to carry out necessary calculations from the observed values.</li>
