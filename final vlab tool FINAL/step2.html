					<p>The second step in the experiment design process is the formulation of learning objectives aligned to the Broad goal of the experiment.</p>
					<ol>
					<li>The learning objectives should identify a learning outcome - The objective needs to state what the learner is to perform, not how the learner learns. For example, “The learner will recite the five steps in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.” 
					Evidence of whether the learners have learned the material lies not in watching them read about it but by listening to them explain the principles in their own words.
					</li>
					<li>
					The learning objectives should be precise — It's sometimes difficult to strike a balance between too much and too little precision in an objective. There is a fine line between choosing objectives that reflect an important and meaningful
					outcome of instruction, objectives that trivialize information into isolated facts, and objectives that are extremely vague. Remember, the purpose of an objective is to give different people the same understanding of the 
					desired instructional outcome. 
					</li>
					</ol>

						As per the definition of learning objectives they need to be very specific and measurable hence you should not use verbs such as understand, visualize etc instead use action verbs such as identify, list,describe,solve etc. 
						Similarly the learning objective should be concerned with the learner and not the teacher hence avoid using verbs such as teach,show,demonstrate etc.

						<i>Examples of valid and clearly defined learning objectives for the course Basic Electronics</i><br><br>
						<ol>
						<li>Student should be able to analyse the BJT amplifier circuits </li>
						<li>Student should be able to describe the effect of the value of β on the output of the amplifier</li>
